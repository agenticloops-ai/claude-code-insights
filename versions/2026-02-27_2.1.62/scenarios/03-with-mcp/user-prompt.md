The following skills are available for use with the Skill tool:

- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: "rebind ctrl+s", "add a chord shortcut", "change the submit key", "customize keybindings".
- claude-developer-platform: Build applications that call the Claude API or Anthropic SDK. Use ONLY when the code actually uses or will use the `anthropic` SDK package or Claude API endpoints.
TRIGGER when:
- Code imports `anthropic` or `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (the Anthropic SDK)
- Code imports `claude_agent_sdk` or `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (the Agent SDK)
- User explicitly asks to use Claude, the Anthropic API, or Anthropic SDK
- User needs an AI/LLM and no other provider's SDK is already in use
DO NOT TRIGGER when (use another skill instead):
- Code imports `openai`, `google.generativeai`, or any non-Anthropic AI SDK
- Filenames contain "openai", "gpt", "gemini" — the code uses a different provider
- The task is general programming with no LLM API calls
- The task is ML/data science (PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Feature names like "extended thinking", "prompt caching", "tool use" appear but the code uses a NON-Anthropic SDK — those are generic concepts, not Claude-specific
CRITICAL: Check the existing code's imports FIRST. If it imports `openai` or another provider, this skill cannot help — it only contains Claude/Anthropic documentation.
- say-hello: Greet the user with a fixed phrase. Use this skill whenever the user asks to be greeted or asks the agent to "say hello" — exists as a deterministic skill fixture for sandbox capture scenarios.
